# Space maps
A series of space maps based on objects in space from public APIs.

# Get planetary data: `download`
There are multiple APIs of space data which require different API calls.
## JPL Horizons

# Preprocess data : `preprocess`
Once we have the data we can standardise it to make the plots independant of the original API.

# Make plots: `plot`
## gravityWell

## moonsOfJupiter

## solarWindRose

# Run code and build webpage: `deploy`
To share these maps the aim is to host a netlify page that updates positions daily.
